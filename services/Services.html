                        <p>I am here to serve you a perfect website for your business, personal and different purpose.I
                            use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the client side of a website. I am responsible for
                            building the visual elements on a page, such as the layout, buttons, menus, forms, and other
                            features that users will see and interact with when they visit a webpage. In contrast with
                            back-end developers, who handle the business logic and data management requirements that
                            power websites from behind the scenes, front-end developers must have a firm grasp of web
                            design fundamentals and the overall user experience of a website.</p>
